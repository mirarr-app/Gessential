## About

Nothing with their Nothing Phone 3a announced an app that allows pushing a dedicated button on the phone to quickly record a note and it transcribes and tags it.
This project aims to provide the similar functionality to other phones by using Gemini api.

## Features

- Gemini tags your notes automatically.
- Either type or talk your note.
- You can later talk or chat with your notes and it tries to provide the context of your notes to Gemini.

## Requirements

You need a Gemini api key which you can get for free from Google AI studio. Without it the app doesn't work.

## Safety of data

Gessential app doesn't collect any data at all. But you're using an online AI. Google states that they don't train models on your data if you pay for their api key if not they will collect and train on your data. How much you want to believe and trust them is on you.
